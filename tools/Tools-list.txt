= Build Functionality =

The build runs an extensive set of checks on the terminology repository:
- that the FHIR resources are all syntactially and semantically valid
- that there are no name clashes etc.
- that the vocabulary design rules (see wiki) are being followed

Then the build produces a set of outputs:
- v2 table definitions for import into the v2 publishing processes
- v3 MIF file(s) for V3 MIF based tooling
- a set of outputs in FHIR IG Format for FHIR IG based tooling
- other formats?

Note that the FHIR build process uses the latest repository directly when publishing FHIR
