HL7 Vocbulary Repository - FHIR

This folder contains the master definitions for 
FHIR code systems and value sets 

This folder does not contain code systems 
that are part of the base resource design (e.g. code 
systems defined for FHIR elements of type 
code, that have a required binding). 

For documentation around working with the vocabulary content,
